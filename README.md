# Motivation
This repository will house code, information, etc. on the infrastructure and means to annotate at Purdue University. Our annotation infrastructure leverages the [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) annotation framework.

[Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/) is "a scriptable annotation tool so efficient that data scientists can do the annotation themselves, enabling a new level of rapid iteration":

>_Todayâ€™s transfer learning technologies mean you can train production-quality models with very few examples. With Prodigy you can take full advantage of modern machine learning by adopting a more agile approach to data collection. You'll move faster, be more independent and ship far more successful projects._

As of January 2021, Prodigy supports the following features:
- [Named Entity Recognition](https://prodi.gy/features/named-entity-recognition#)
- [Dependencies & Relations](https://prodi.gy/features/dependencies-relations)
- [Audio and Video Classification](https://prodi.gy/features/audio-video)
- [Audio and Video Transcription](https://prodi.gy/features/audio-video)
- [Text Classification](https://prodi.gy/features/text-classification) (multi-class and binary!)
- [Computer Vision](https://prodi.gy/features/computer-vision)
    - Image Annotation
    - Image Classifcation
    - Image Options
    - Image Captioning
- [A/B Evaluation](https://prodi.gy/features/ab-evaluation)

# How to Access
Students at Purdue University can contact Justin Gould within [the Data Mine](https://datamine.purdue.edu/) at gould29@purdue.edu to learn more.

# Prodigy Usage
Currently, we are exploring using Prodigy via [the JupyterLab extension](https://github.com/explosion/jupyterlab-prodigy):
