# Combining Prodigy Datasets
Prodigy for Teams is not yet available; however, the value in annotating at an organization-wide scale is present now. To close this current gap, I offer utilities to combine datasets from numerous annotators:
  - Combine datasets within a single SQLite database (`prodigy.db`).
  - Combine datasets stored in multiple SQLite databases (`prodigy.db`).

# Usage
Please see `demo.ipynb` for a demonstration of the Python functionality I developed. All source code is located in the `./src` directory.
